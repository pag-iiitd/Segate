# Segate
SEGATE (Semantic Gap Tester) is a test generation tool for structured  string  inputs where we infer inconsistencies in input definition to expose semantic gaps in the method under test and the method specification.

The repository contains the evaluation dataset for the proposed automated testing technique to expose functional gap in programs. The excel datasheet containing the evaluation details may be downloaded from String-related-relevant-bugs.xlsx

Running the tool: The tool along with a bundled example can be found in segate.zip. 
Bundle with more test-samples with instructions to replicate evaluation results is available in segate_extra.zip.
